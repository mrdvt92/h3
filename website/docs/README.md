H3 is a geospatial indexing system that partitions the world into hexagonal cells. H3 is open source under the Apache 2 license.

The H3 Core Library implements the H3 grid system. It includes functions for converting from latitude and longitude coordinates to the containing H3 cell, finding the center of H3 cells, finding the boundary geometry of H3 cells, finding neighbors of H3 cells, and more.

## Highlights

* The H3 Core Library is written in *C*. [Bindings for many other languages](/docs/community/bindings) are available.
* H3 was developed to address the [challenges of Uber's data science needs](/docs/highlights/aggregation).
